### Usage

Place trumpspeeches.txt

----word-level.py------------------------

	1. It will implement the word-level neural network language model.

	2. input_word='you' (starting word for sentence generation after training)
	   
	   Generated sentences are written in  word_level_sentence.txt file.

----char-level.py-------------------------------

	1. It will implement the char-level neural network language model.
	
    2. input_char='q' (starting char for sentence generation after training)
	   
	   Generated sentences are written in char_level_sentence.txt file.
